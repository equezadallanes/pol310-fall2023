{"title":"Assignments","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Assignments"},"headingText":"Weekly Summaries (20% of final grade)","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nIn this course, you will write weekly summaries, a response paper to a week's readings, a campaign strategy memo, and a research design paper. In addition, you will do an oral presentation of your research design. You can find more information about each assignment below and in their respective pages.\n\n\n\nTo receive full points, you will need to write seven (7) summaries throughout the course. There will be 10 weeks during which you can write a summary, so that means you can skip 3 weeks. The specific reading you have to summarize in any given week will be in bold font in the corresponding topic page. It is up to you which weeks you decide to skip. The summary should not be longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas prior to class on the day for which the reading is assigned. No credit will be given for submissions after class has started.\n\nYou can find a brief guide on how to write a summary [here](../resource/summaries.html).\n\n\n## Response Paper (10% of final grade)\n\nYou will write a response paper (2 double-spaced pages, 12-point font) where you integrate the readings for a given week. In the response paper, you will highlight the connections between the readings, write about their applicability to the role of Latines in American politics today, and offer a critique of the readings as a whole. You may choose to focus more on applicability to today or a critique of existing research.\n\nMore info on how to craft a critique of research to come.\n\n\n## Campaign Strategy Memo (15% of final grade)\n\nYou will write a campaign strategy memo (4-6 pages, single-spaced) for a state-wide race that focuses on Latine outreach. Since there is an upcoming election, you will write the memo as if you were part of a real campaign for a real candidate who will be running in the November 2024 election. The memo must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latines in the state. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.^[Papers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized with one point off for each 24-hour period after the due date.]\n\nIf we reach a consensus in class, we will craft a strategy focused on the presidential campaign and each student will write the strategy for one state.\n\n\n## Oral Research Presentation (10% of final grade)\n\nYou will do a conference-style presentation of your research design paper toward the end of the course. You will receive feedback on your research design and give feedback on the research design of other students in the course.\n\n\n## Research Design Paper (25% of final grade)\n\nThe research design paper is the final paper for the course. A research design paper is what we might call the \"front end\" of a paper. It includes the research question, the motivation, a literature review, the theory, and a strategy for how you would answer the question (i.e., the research design). While you have to specify what kind of data you would collect and how you might analyze it, you do not have to collect or analyze the data. The paper must be at least 8 pages and not more than 12 pages (double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins).\n\nSince this is a major paper, and maybe the first time you write a paper like this, we will break down the paper into separate components as follows:\n\n1. [Research question and list of literature](research-question.qmd) (5% of final grade)\n2. [Literature review](literature-review.qmd) (5% of final grade)\n3. [Theory and research design](research-design.qmd) (5% of final grade)\n4. [Full research design paper](final-paper.qmd) (10% of final grade)\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../newpagelink.lua"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","resources":["../CNAME"],"_quarto-vars":{"author":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","instructor":{"name":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","name_no_title":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","email":"equezada@agnesscott.edu","url":"https://www.equezadallanes.com","twitter":"oequezada","github":"equezadallanes","office":"Buttrick Hall 315","appointment_url":null},"course":{"number":"POL 330","semester":"Spring 2024","days":"MWF","time":"9:30 AM – 10:20 AM","location":"Buttrick Hall, Room 215","dates":"January 9–May 8, 2023"},"university":{"name":"Agnes Scott College","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu"},"school":{"name":"Department of Political Science","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/majors-minors/political-science/index.html"}},"theme":["litera","../html/custom.scss"],"title":"Assignments"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
