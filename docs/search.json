    "section": "Task",
    "text": "Task\nAttend one religious service at a congregation from a religious tradition/denomination other than your own. Keep track of the number and types of political stimuli as well as the opportunities available for political engagement. Write a 3- to 5-page report (double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins) of what you observed.\nAs we read in the piece by Brewer, Kersh, and Petersen (2003), while religious services are not political events, this does not mean they do not include political stimuli. In fact, they find that the average service had 2.8 political messages (with a high of 9 and a low of 0). These observations, however, come from religious services from the late 1990s, and things may look quite different now than they did back then. Do religious individuals hear more political messages now than they did in 1998-99? Are the types of messages individuals hear more political or direct?\nTo ensure that we can compare our data with the rest of the class, we will be using the same classification as Brewer et al. (2003). There are several ways you can record and code these messages. One way is to keep track of the content of the messages you hear and see and leave coding for a later time. In addition to this, you could record the audio from the service in case you want to double-check something from your notes.\nIn your essay, provide some background information on the congregation you visited and the religious tradition/denomination they are affiliated with (if any). Then describe your findings using the classification of political messages described above. Make sure to be clear about how you are classifying the political cues and provide examples from your visits. Finally, reflect on whether your findings (i.e., the types and amount of political messages) fit with what you know about that religious tradition/denomination."

Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\n\nOp-ed (3-5 pages):\n\nstudents will write an op-ed on a topic of their choice. Students must make a clear argument and use class material to help them organize their essays or provide context to the situation.\n\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas.

    "text": "Work and Assessment\n\nCourse Expectations\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate during class discussions. This course has both a lecture and a discussion component. The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Readings can be accessed through the library resources or, when not available through the library, via Canvas.\n\n\nA note of caution:\n\nmany, if not most, of the readings come from academic journals and books, mostly from political science but also from sociology. You will find that many of the articles are quite technical and they can be hard to follow even when one is familiar with the methodology. Do not despair. Make sure to understand, and wrestle with, the main ideas presented in a piece. Pay attention as well to how the authors support their arguments with data without getting bogged down by technical details.\n\n\n\nCourse Workload\nThis is a 4-credit hour course, meaning that you are expected to spend 12 hours of work each week (including the 3 hours spent in the classroom). This roughly means that you will spend about 2 hours on readings for each class period, and 3 hours each week working on the different assignments (pace yourself!).\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n< 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (20%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have three unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. Note that students who are absent, whether excused or not, are still expected to submit the weekly summary corresponding to that class period.\n\nWeekly summaries (20%): Each week for eight weeks, you will summarize one article from the week’s readings (the reading appears in bold font on the course website). Since there are more than eight weeks in the semester, you can skip some weeks. It is up to you to decide which weeks to skip. The summary must be no longer than three-quarters of a page (single-spaced, 12-point font). These summaries must be submitted via Canvas before class time on the day the reading was assigned.\nThree Short Papers (10% each): You will be writing three short papers (approx. 4-6 pages) throughout the course. These assignments will require you to think about how what we learn in class relates to what you can observe in your political environment (also known as the “real world”). You can find a short description of each paper below:\n\n\nCongregational visit paper (4-6 pages):\n\nstudents will attend two religious services of a religious tradition or denomination other than their own and will write about how politics is (or is not) addressed, directly or indirectly, in that particular congregation.\n\nCampaign memo (4-6 pages, single-spaced):\n\nstudents will write a campaign memo on the political attitudes and behaviors of Latinos/as. Students must provide sufficient background, provide clear takeaways, and propose strategies for a political campaign to appeal to Latino voters. The audience for this paper is a political campaign staff.\n\nOp-ed (3-5 pages):\n\nstudents will write an op-ed on a topic of their choice. Students must make a clear argument and use class material to help them organize their essays or provide context to the situation.\n\n\nPapers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized: half a point (out of 10) if turned in late but on the same day and one point for each 24-hour period after the due date.\n\nMidterm and Final Exam (15% each): There will be a midterm and a final exam. The midterm will be completed in the classroom, while the final exam will take place during the final exam period and will be administered on Canvas. These exams will assess your familiarity with the terms and theories in the religion and politics literature that we will have covered in class."

    "title": "Writing a Summary",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Writing a summary may seem to some like an easy task, while others might find it daunting. I think it’s both. Understanding what should go in a summary it’s crucial. This will not only help you write more useful summaries, but it will also help you become a more intentional reader.\nA summary should help you or someone else understand the main points of the piece as well as some of its context. It should answer the following questions:\n\nWhy is the text relevant? Why did the author(s) write it?\nWhat is the main conclusion of the text?\nHow do the author(s) reach their conclusions?\n(Optional, but useful) How does this work fit in with other texts or your observations?\n\nI would argue that a good summary for a journal article can be short (~5 sentences) or a bit longer (three-quarters of a page), depending on the level of detail that is required. For this class, anything in between these two lengths will suffice. I care much more about the content of the summary than its length.\n\nExample 1 - Abstracted structure of a summary\n\nThis is a little example of what a summary can look like (purpose/argument). Many students struggle to write summaries, and they end up outlining a text instead of summarizing the main points (context/relevance). To solve this, I am creating a page that includes questions a summary should answer, one abstract example of a summary, and two summaries of journal artices to help students write their summaries (method). Students read and referenced this page throughout the course (fingers crossed!) to write fantastic summaries of political science research (results). This shows that students only need a little guidance to achieve good results (implications).\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Summary of journal article\nIn the example below, I summarized this article:\n\nFrancis, R. W. (2006). Using Concept Maps as Assessment Tools: Defining Understanding. College Quarterly, 9(3), n3.1\n\nYou should be able to find the various parts highlighted above.\n\nThis article seeks to establish how concept maps can be useful for assessing understanding. Because concept maps structure knowledge, they can reveal how much students know and how they connect the ideas and concepts they have learned. To assess how many concepts and links between these concepts show understanding and breadth, the study uses upper-level education students and asks them to create concept maps for “effective teaching.” The resulting concept maps are divided into four levels and the conclusion is that concept maps that show breadth and depth of understanding have as many entries as the number of links to the main idea multiplied by ten. Although this research points in the opposite direction and its results do not seem generalizable (a good concept map may be denser or sparser depending on the discipline), it may be a good assessment tool and a way to show whether students who perform better have more structured, full concept maps.\n\n\n\nExample 3 - Longer summary of journal article\nThis example summarizes the following article:\n\nWald, Kenneth D., Dennis E. Owen, and Samuel S. Hill. 1988. “Churches as Political Communities.” American Political Science Review 82(2): 531–48.2\n\nAfter reading the summary, see if you can abstract the structure from the text.\n\nSummary\nWald, Owen, and Hill examine how an individual’s religious context affects their political attitudes. More specifically, the authors focus on how the religious beliefs of a congregation as a whole influence individual church members’ levels of moral conservatism and conservative ideology. Given the leadership structure and the repeated interactions between members of a church community, congregations represent a powerful social context for the dissemination of information and the enforcement of norms. As a competing explanation, the authors explore the influence of individual-level theology alongside congregational-level beliefs to ascertain whether an individual’s political attitudes are best explained by their own religious beliefs or those of their congregation.\nTo test their theory of congregational influence, the authors contacted churches in Gainesville, Florida, and obtained 657 completed surveys from 21 different congregations. The authors constructed a moral conservatism index by aggregating individual attitudes on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, birth control, drugs, and interracial marriage. Political ideology was measured through a standard self-placement measure on a 5-point scale, ranging from strongly liberal to strongly conservative. As their explanatory variable, theological conservatism taps into views about the Bible and evangelism as well as a respondent’s “born-again” experience. To obtain measures of moral, political, and theological conservatism at the congregation level, the authors calculate the average of the individual responses from each congregation.\nIn a series of multivariate regression analyses, the authors find that the more conservative the religious beliefs of a congregation the higher their levels of moral conservatism will be for both the congregation and the individuals. Although to a lesser extent, the same pattern holds when using political conservatism, measured through self-reported ideology, as the dependent variable. Additionally, while individual religious beliefs are also correlated with political attitudes, the impact of personal theology is not as large as that of the congregation’s theology. These results hold after accounting for individual-level characteristics such as partisanship, education, race, and age, and the possibility of individuals self-selecting into like-minded congregations. The findings underscore the importance of group-level influences on individual political attitudes.\n\n\nStructure\n\nThe first paragraph provides the main argument and tell us where the piece is situated in the literature.\nThe second paragraph tells us the methodology the authors use to evaluate their argument.\nThe third paragraph tells us the most important findings and what they mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis citation follows the APA citation style.↩︎\nThis citation follows the APSA citation style.↩︎"
