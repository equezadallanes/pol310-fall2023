In addition, it will help you communicate these ideas in the context of a campaign.\n\n## Task\n\n*Write a 4- to 6-page memo for a congressional campaign (single-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins). First, choose a congressional district and define your candidate (provide information on the candidate as an appendix). Next, imagine you are part of the staff and have been hired specifically to help the campaign define its strategy for religious outreach. In the memo, provide your candidate and the campaign with the information and advice they need to understand the religious landscape of their district and how this might impact any campaign messaging and/or mobilization efforts.*\n\nMake sure to provide clear takeaways for your candidate and campaign. Think about three things you want the staff to remember and be able to execute. The information and analysis you present support those conclusions.\n\n\n## Criteria for success\n\nA successful essay will:\n\n1. Describe the religious and political characteristics of the constituency.\n2. Provide an analysis of the potential for mobilizing these voters and how you would do this.\n3. Clearly define three takeaways for the campaign about how to reach out to religious voters considering the proportion of non-religious voters in the district.\n4. Have a coherent structure (paragraphs and headers are your friends here) and no grammatical errors.^[I recommend you use software like Grammarly to have one less thing to worry about.]\n5. Reference at least two readings from class using [Chicago style](https://politics.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/chicago%20style%20guide.pdf) for citations (i.e., footnotes). \n\nCite academic work in an appropriate tone for the audience. For example, I recommend not using the article's title or even mentioning the authors in the text. Instead, just say \"researchers,\" \"scholars,\" \"political scientists,\" \"sociologists,\" or use any other general terms. The full reference should be in the footnote, per Chicago style. \n\n\n## Resources\n\nHere are two examples of campaign memos. These address various groups a campaign might target so it will be useful to look at them again. Use these examples to understand the genre and see how they are structured. Consider the following: What is important in this pieces of writing? How are those goals reflected in how the text is organized? How is it reflected in the tone of the piece?\n\n- [Biden campaign memo example](https://www.wispolitics.com/2020/biden-campaign-memo)\n- [Buttigieg campaign memo example](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6785938-Path-to-Nomination.html)\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../newpagelink.lua"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"campaign-memo.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","_quarto-vars":{"author":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","instructor":{"name":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","name_no_title":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","email":"equezada@agnesscott.edu","url":"https://www.equezadallanes.com","twitter":"oequezada","github":"equezadallanes","office":"Buttrick Hall 315","appointment_url":null},"course":{"number":"POL 310","semester":"Fall 2023","days":"MWF","time":"9:30 AM – 10:20 AM","location":"Buttrick Hall, Room 221","dates":"August 23–December 13, 2023"},"university":{"name":"Agnes Scott College","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu"},"school":{"name":"Department of Political Science","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/majors-minors/political-science/index.html"}},"theme":["litera","../html/custom.scss"],"title":"Campaign Memo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
