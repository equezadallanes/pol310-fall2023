title: "Writing an Op-ed"
---

While there is no single way to write an op-ed, the following structure may help you identify the different parts you need and a common way to organize them. This comes from [The OpEd Project](https://www.theopedproject.org/resources#structure), where you can find more information to guide you.

1. Lede and news hook
    - Grab your reader's attention using a recent news story that would be of interest to your audience
2. Thesis statement
3. Argument (with evidence; use many paragraphs)
    - 1st point (use evidence)
   - 2nd point (use evidence)
    - 3rd point (use evidence)
4. "To be sure" paragraph
    - Address potential criticism.
5. Conclusion
    - Connect your conclusion back to the lede.
