Your op-ed may address a current policy debate, news story, or political science finding you think would help you and your peers understand the role of religion in contemporary American politics. The op-ed should be between 600-1,200 words (single-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins). Use Times New Roman or Arial font.*\n\nAn op-ed is a short opinion piece intended for the general readership of a publication. Many academics write op-eds as a way to communicate their research to people outside their field that they believe could help illuminate an important political event.\n\nIn your op-ed, make sure to include at least *two pieces of information* (e.g., concepts, ideas, frameworks, contextual information) that you learned in class and found particularly helpful for your understanding of this topic to make your argument.\n\n[Click here](../resource/op-ed.qmd) for more details about how to write an op-ed.\n\n\n## Criteria for success\n\nA successful essay will:\n\n1. Have an effective lede (i.e., hook) and a clear thesis statement.\n2. Identify at least two concepts/ideas/information from class.\n3. Provide persuasive evidence for the argument.\n4. Use clear and concise language (avoid jargon).\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../newpagelink.lua"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"op-ed.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","_quarto-vars":{"author":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","instructor":{"name":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","name_no_title":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","email":"equezada@agnesscott.edu","url":"https://www.equezadallanes.com","twitter":"oequezada","github":"equezadallanes","office":"Buttrick Hall 315","appointment_url":null},"course":{"number":"POL 310","semester":"Fall 2023","days":"MWF","time":"9:30 AM – 10:20 AM","location":"Buttrick Hall, Room 215","dates":"August 23–December 13, 2023"},"university":{"name":"Agnes Scott College","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu"},"school":{"name":"Department of Political Science","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/majors-minors/political-science/index.html"}},"theme":["litera","../html/custom.scss"],"title":"Op-ed"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
